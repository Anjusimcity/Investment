  * Mutual funds (legally known as open-end companies)
  * Closed-end funds (legally known as closed-end companies)
  * Exchange traded-funds (ETFs)
  * Unit investment trusts (UITs)

**Open ended:**
There is no limit on the number of shares that can be issued by a Mutual Fund.

**Seed Capital:**
Initial investment amount that should be atleast $100,000 before the shares are distributed to the public. 
MF is created from the Seed capital which is supplied by fund sponser.

**Assets under management (AUM):**
Refers to the total market value of investments managed by a mutual fund, money management firm, hedge fund, portfoliomanager, or other financial services company.

**NAV**
The Net Asset Value is calculated by taking the value of all existing assets/holdings at current market prices and subtracting the value of all current liabilities. 

For example, if a mutual fund has assets of USD 120 million and liabilities of USD 20 million, its NAV will be USD 100 million. NAV is frequently expressed in 'dollars per share' by dividing by the number of shares that have been issued by the fund.

Unlike stocks, where continuous real-time pricing information is available with relative ease, mutual funds generally calculate their NAV only once – at the end of each trading day (when the closing market prices of the portfolio's securities are known).

**MF Returns**
* Fund Distributions: Dividends paid out to investors.
* Share Redemptions: Shares sold back to the fund or 3rd party acting as funds.
